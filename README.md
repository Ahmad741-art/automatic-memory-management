# automatic-memory-management-python

Automatic memory management in Python automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation using **reference counting** and **garbage collection**. This ensures efficient memory usage without manual intervention by the programmer.

Example: Can be found at the repository included with this readme file

Key point:
Python's automatic memory management, through reference counting and garbage collection, ensures that memory is efficiently managed without requiring explicit memory management from the programmer.
